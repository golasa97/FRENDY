1. Directory structure of FRENDY
    The directory structure of FRENDY is as follows:
      frend_project
       |- README : This file
       |- frendy : Source files of FRENDY
       |- tests  : Source files to run the Boost.Test library for verification
       |- sample : Input files for the test calculations
       |- tools  : Tools which use FRENDY modules.


2. How to Install FRENDY on Linux, UNIX or MacOS Platforms
    A shell script of "compile_all.csh" is included in the "frendy" directory
    to compile FRENDY source codes. The user run only this shell script or issue
    the "make" command in "frendy/main" or "frendy/main_njoy_mode" directory.
    FRENDY has the NJOY mode which processes the evaluated nuclear data file with
    the NJOY calculation method. The executable file in "frendy/main_njoy_mode" 
    calculates using the NJOY calculation method.

    The default compiler to process FRENDY is GCC.
    If the user wants to use aother compiler or modify the compiler option,
    please change "CXX = g++" for compiler and "CXXFLAGS = -Wall -O2 -MMD -MP"
    for compiler option.

    FRENDY uses AMUR code to process the R-matrix Limited in the
    resonance reconstruction. The AMUR code uses the function of
    the LAPACK library. Users have to install the LAPACK library
    before they compile FRENDY.
    If the user does not want to use the LAPACK library (or the
    reconstruction of the R-matrix Limited is not required),
    please add and modify following lines in frendy/main/Makefile
      CXXFLAGS = -Wall -O2 -MMD -MP -I../ 
      CXXFLAGS = -Wall -O2 -MMD -MP -I../ -DNO_AMUR_MODE
    and
      $(CXX) -o $@ $^ -L. -llapack -lblas
      $(CXX) -o $@ $^ -L.


3. Source files to run the Boost.Test library for verification
    FRENDY prepares test program using Boost.Test library to verify
    each class and each function.
    The test program for each class are prepared in
    "frend_project/tests" directory.
    If the user wants to run this test program, please run
    "run_all_class.csh" shell in "tests" directory.
    Note that the compiler for this test program is GCC. If user
    wants to use other compiler, the user has to change all shells
    in "tests" directory.


4. Test calculation with samples.
    The sample input files which are listed in the FRENDY manual
    are used in this sample calculation.
    Nuclides and materials are obtained from JENDL-4.0.
      
    The directory structure of sample directory is as follows:
      sample
       |- input : Input file to generate ACE file
       |- lib   : Nuclear data (from JENDL-4.0)
       |- run   : Running of FRENDY

    The user runs only shell (run_all.csh) to calculate samples.
    The calculation time is about 3 hours using a CPU (3.70 GHz).
